# The Internet

More or less, the internet. I probably wouldn't try to install this if I were you.

## Installation

    $ npm install the-internet

## Usage
None really, but after installing, you'll have a shitload of packages to deal with.

## FAQ

### Why would I do this?
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

### Whats all this about?
Welp, `the-internet` requires around 2000 of the most "required" npm packages. Seemed fitting.

### I just tried to install this. Why would you do this to me?
I'm sorry.
