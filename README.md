# The Internet

More or less, the internet. I probably wouldn't try to install this if I were you. I guess if you were leaving the internet, or society behind it wouldn't hurt. But thats an edge case!

## Installation

    $ npm install git://github.com/tholman/the-internet.git
    
Sadly, this can't exist on the npm registry... because, well.

## Usage
None really, but after installing, you'll have a literal ton of packages to deal with.

## FAQ

### Whats all this about?
Welp, `the-internet` depends upon around 2000 of the most "required" npm packages. Seemed fitting.

### Why would I do this?
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

### I just tried to install this. Why would you do this to me?
I'm sorry.
